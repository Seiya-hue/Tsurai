        <h1>Number Systems</h1>
        <p>A <b>number system</b> is a set of symbols and rules used to represent numbers.<br>
            It defines the base or radix of the system, which determines the number of unique digits used.<br>
            Each digit in a number system has a specific value or weight, depending on its position.</p>

            <h2><b>Decimal Number System</b></h2>
            <p><b>Digits:</b> 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9</p><br>
            <p>The decimal number system, also known as the base-10 system, is a numeral system that uses ten distinct digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. 
            It is called "base-10" because it is based on powers of 10. This system is the standard system for denoting integer and non-integer numbers in everyday life.</p>

            <h2>Binary Number System</h2>
            <p><b>Digits:</b> 0, 1</p><br>
            <p>The binary number system is a base-2 numeral system, which means it uses only two digits: 0 and 1. 
            It is the fundamental number system used in computers and digital electronics, as all data is processed in binary.</p>

            <h2>Octal Number System</h2>
            <p><b>Digits:</b> 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7</p><br>
            <p>The octal number system is a base-8 numeral system, which means it uses eight digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. 
            Each digit in an octal number represents a power of 8, similar to how each digit in the decimal system represents a power of 10.
            The octal system is used in computing because it provides a more compact way to represent binary numbers. 
            Each octal digit corresponds to exactly three binary digits (bits), making it easier to work with binary data.
            This allows for simpler conversion between binary and octal, especially in older computer systems or applications where octal was used for efficiency in representing large binary numbers.</p>

            <h2>Hexadecimal Number System</h2>
            <p><b>Digits:</b> 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F</p><br>
            <p>The hexadecimal number system is a base-16 numeral system, meaning it uses sixteen symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F. 
            The digits A, B, C, D, E, and F represent the decimal values 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15, respectively.
            Each digit in a hexadecimal number represents a power of 16, just like in the decimal system where each digit represents a power of 10.
            Hexadecimal is often used in computing because it provides a more compact and human-readable way to represent binary data. 
            Since each hexadecimal digit represents exactly four binary digits (or bits), it is easier to convert between binary and hexadecimal.
            This makes hexadecimal particularly useful in programming, memory addressing, and working with low-level data, as it simplifies large binary numbers.</p>
